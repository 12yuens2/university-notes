\section{Locks and lock-free}
In programming with locks, we want to be explicit about goals and trade-offs. A benefit in one dimension often has costs in another. For example an increase in performance that prevents a data structure from being used in some particular setting. The ultimate goal is to increase performance, either as time or resources used. The trade-off is generally if an implementation can scale well enough to out-perform a good sequential implementation.

There are three kinds of parallel hardware
\begin{enumerate}
\item Multi-threaded cores
\item Multiple cores
\item Mult-processor machines
\end{enumerate}
