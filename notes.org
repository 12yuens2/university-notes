*** Types of machine learning
- Supervised 
  - classification
  - regression

- Unsupervised
  - clustering 

*** Supervised Learning
- Use *labelled dataset* to predict the value for unknown outputs given data form the same input features
- =y= the output, what we want to predict
- =x= input, the feature set (labelled data)

Error in model is difference between the model and actual value of dataset

**** Regression example
Given the length of time to grow a pumpkin, what is its diameter
- Data to predict is usually continuous, if discrete, have to round predicted value to the closest discrete value
- Do not extrapolate beyond the limits of the data as we will be making assumption of something unknown

**** Overfitting
If overfitting to dataset, harder to generalise outside of given dataset
- makes the model less likely to work for test data (prediction)


**** Classification (Logistic regression)
+ Decision boundary :: Everything on one side is one classification and another classification on the other side

Possible to have hyper-dimensional decision boundaries (more the 3 features that we care about) which cannot be easily visualised.

+ Classification :: the probability it is of some class, not it *is* this class based on distance from the decision boundary.


*** Unsupervised Learning
Using *unlabelled datasets*
- Don't know what the output is to predict values for
- Can be used to discover things we don't know about
- Automatically create clusters in the data to separate them into distinct groups
