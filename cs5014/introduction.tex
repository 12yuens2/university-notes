\section{Introduction}
In machine learning, we wish to \textit{learn} the mapping between input and output without having to program it explicitly.

\begin{displayquote}
Maching learning is the field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed. - Arther Samuel.
\end{displayquote}

\begin{displayquote}
A computer program is said to learn from exerience $E$ with respect to some task $T$ and some performance measure $P$, if its performance on $T$, as measured by $P$, improves with experience $E$.
\end{displayquote}
\noindent
In general, most machine learning boils down to a simple prediction equation.
\begin{align}
  \^{Y} &= f(X, \theta)
  Y &= f(X, \theta) + \varepsilon
\end{align}
where $f$ is a mathematical model for predicting $Y$ from $X$. $X$ is a list of input features that are used for prediction. They could be independent variables or some kind of predictor. $\^{Y}$ is the output of the predicting model which are the predicted values. $\theta$ are the model parameters that the model tries to learn and optimise for. Finally, $\varepsilon$ is the error, which represents the difference between predicted values and desired values.
